# there is problem in the review page the user should pass to the next move and return to the previous 
# and the data i have is not enough to do that because i dont have screenshot of the board at every move and i dont have record in case of captured pieace 
# so my idea is take the array of object and create record of the board at any move  
# pass the board to render board
